I recently created a simple mini-calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helped me strengthen my skills in DOM manipulation and event handling to perform real-time calculations.

Features:

✅ Perform basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

✅ Calculate percentages

✅ Reset with the "C" button

✅ Minimalist and functional user interface

This small project demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to create interactive and practical tools directly in the browser.
